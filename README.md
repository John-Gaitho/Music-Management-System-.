# Music Management System
### Developed by JOHN GAITHO (Music Producer & Developer).

This is a Music Management System, a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to manage artists, albums, and tracks in a music database. It uses SQLAlchemy for database operations and SQLite as the database engine. The application allows you to create, delete, and view artists, albums, and tracks.
An artist can have multiple albums (one-to-many relationship), meaning one artist can release many albums. Each album can contain multiple tracks (one-to-many relationship), so an album can have many songs or pieces of music. Each track is associated with exactly one album (many-to-one relationship). This ensures that artists are connected to their albums.
